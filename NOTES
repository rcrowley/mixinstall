Use a .mixinstall file level with .gitignore to track already mixed projects

Use special named sections in .gitignore to note every file that is part of a mixed project

Default to the --git argument but accept --svn to control how the mixed project is downloaded

Default to /tmp/<project> for staging

mixinstall init [<project>] [--git|--svn] <url> [<base>]
	Figure out <project> from URL if not given
	<base> is relative to the repo root
mixinstall up|update [<project>]
mixinstall rm|remove <project>

For init and update, fail if any mixed file would overwrite one in the main project
