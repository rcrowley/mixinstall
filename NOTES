x	Use a .mixinstall file level with .gitignore to track already mixed projects

x	Use special named sections in .gitignore to note every file that is part of a mixed project

	Default to the --git argument but accept --svn to control how the mixed project is downloaded

x	Default to /tmp/<project> for staging

mixinstall init <project> [--git|--svn] <url> [<base>]
	Figure out <project> from URL if not given
	<base> is relative to the repo root
mixinstall clone <project> [--git|--svn] <url> [<base>]
	Does an init and then an update
mixinstall up|update [<project>]
mixinstall rm|remove <project>

x	For init and update, fail if any mixed file would overwrite one in the main project

Would be cool to do diffs of mixed files if the user has changed them

Automatically add and commit .gitignore and .mixinstall after update?
	Have to be careful if the user has stuff in the index
	Maybe a --commit option?
	Could also just require repo to be clean before doing any mixinstalls

Need a mixinstall list command to see what mixed projects we have
