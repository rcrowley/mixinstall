NAME
	Mixinstall -- Manage read-only "mixed projects" within your own

SYNOPSIS
	mixinstall init|clone <project> <repository> [<base>]
	mixinstall update|up [<project>]
	mixinstall remove|rm <project>
	mixinstall list|ls [<project>]

DESCRIPTION
	Manages read-only "mixed projects" in the same directory tree as your
	project.  Enables you to track the head of one or more other Git
	repositories without polluting your own.  Mixinstall explicitly doesn't
	support directly modifying a mixed project.

	Mixinstall was written in the spirit of small pieces, loosely joined.

INSTALLATION
